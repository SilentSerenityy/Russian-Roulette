Simple Russian Roulette game I coded because I was bored and I wanted to test how cool it would be to use something as simple as a python randomizer to make a good game.
So there you have it. Russian Roulette by the one and only Shadi.
Comments littered around the main.py code should be able to help you comprehend and understand how it all works.
